    <h2 id="orange">The Pawn</h2>

    <p>
      <b>The Pawn</b> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its ability
      to work with other pawns and to become promoted. Pawn chains can be very
      powerful and a pawn can be <i>Promoted</i> to another peice if it reaches
      the other side of the board

    <!--Knight Section-->

    <h2 id="blue">The Knight</h2>

    <p>
      The Knight is one of my <b>favourite</b> pieces because of its unique
      L-shaped movement and ability to jump over other pieces. It is
      <i>impossible</i>
      to block a Knight

    <!--Queen Section-->
    <h2 id="red">The Queen</h2>

    <p>
      The Queen is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its power. The
      Queen can move <b>any number of spaces in any direction!</b>
    </p>
